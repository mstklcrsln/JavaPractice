/*
### Use a `loop` to count the number of triples in the given `str`. A triple is when the same character appears three times in a row.
So if there is a specific character that is repeated three times,
that will be counted as one triple.
Print the total number of triples found in the String. The triples may overlap.

```
Ex:
  Input:
    abcXXXabc
  Output:
    1
```
```
Ex:
  Input:
    xxxabyyyycd
  Output:
    3

  -> the triples found are xxx yyy and another yyy
```
```
Ex:
  Input:
    java
  Output:
    0
```
