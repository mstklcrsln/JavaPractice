/*
### There is a zombie disease pandemic wiping out populations. Use a `loop` to keep track of the city's population.
 The starting population is given as the `inhabitants` value.
 Each day the city is losing half of its population. Write the program that will show the population day by day, until the city gets to zero.

#### Note: Case sensitivity should be considered. We are looking for the lowercase character versions of both Strings

```
Ex:
  Input:
    6

  Output:
    Day 0 [6]
    Day 1 [3]
    Day 2 [1]
    ---- EXTINCT ----
```
```
Ex:
  Input:
    20

  Output:
    Day 0 [20]
    Day 1 [10]
    Day 2 [5]
    Day 3 [2]
    Day 4 [1]
    ---- EXTINCT ----
